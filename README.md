# Hi there, I'm Vincent Le 👋

## About Myself 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience building scalable web applications across fintech, real estate, and SEO platforms.

I specialize in frontend architecture, performance optimization, and reusable component systems. My work has supported platforms serving 100,000+ daily users and enterprise banking workflows for 3,000+ managers.

Recently, I’ve been deepening my expertise in network and security architecture (GPA 4.1/4.2, Dean’s Honour List), combining software engineering with infrastructure and security principles.

My goal is to design clean, modular systems that scale — technically, operationally, and for the teams maintaining them.
